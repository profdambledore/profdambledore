##  Hello, I'm Dan
- I currently work with Unreal Engine, but I am always open to try new languages/IDE's
- Both of my degrees were focused around Unreal Engine 4
- I enjoy recreating features from the games I play
- I am interested in joining a team working on an existing project
  
After finishing my degrees, I am now ready and excited to start work in the industry!  If you are looking for a motivated and eager developer, please contact me on Twitter, send me an email or message me on Discord and I can provide you with my resume.
  
Cheers,
  
Dan

  Prototype: FoodGame is the project I am currently working on. It places the player in their own small food restaraunt, where they must cook food, complete orders and serve customers to beat time limits and keep the day going - Crazy Taxi style.
  
  To see where the project is currently, you can view the repo here - [Link](https://github.com/profdambledore/FoodGame)
