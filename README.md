##  Hello, I an Dan
- I currently work with Unreal Engine, but I am always open to try new languages/IDE's
- Both of my degrees were focused around Unreal Engine 4
- I enjoy recreating features from the games I play
- I am interested in joining a team working on an existing project
  
After finishing my degrees, I am now ready and excited to start work in the industry!  If you are looking for a motivated and eager developer, please contact me on Twitter, send me an email or message me on Discord.
